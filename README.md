# K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation

## Overview
This project implements a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments that can help in tailoring marketing strategies and improving customer satisfaction.

## Introduction
Understanding customer behavior is crucial for businesses. This project uses clustering techniques to analyze customer data and create segments based on their spending behavior and income levels. 

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **Mall Customers** dataset, which contains the following columns:
- `CustomerID`: Unique ID assigned to the customer
- `Gender`: Gender of the customer (Male/Female)
- `Age`: Age of the customer
- `Annual Income (k$)`: Annual income of the customer (in thousands)
- `Spending Score (1-100)`: Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and relevant features are selected for clustering.
2. **Standardization**: The features are standardized to ensure optimal performance of the K-means algorithm.
3. **Elbow Method**: The elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
4. **Clustering**: K-means clustering is applied to segment the customers.
5. **Visualization**: The resulting clusters are visualized to understand the segments better.

## Results
- The K-means algorithm successfully segmented the customers into distinct clusters.
- Visualizations demonstrate the distribution of customers across different segments based on their annual income and spending score.
